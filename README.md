# Northwestern Group Project 1 - Dog Data Analysis 

This repository is a clone of a group project that was completed during my Northwestern Data Science Bootcamp.  The project utilized an API saved here:  https://api-ninjas.com/api/dogs This API was converted into a dataframe to seek answers to the following questions

Questions:
1. Do smaller dogs bark more?
2. What are the life expectancies of different sized dogs?
3. Is there a correlation between a dog's height and weight?
